# Hash Tool

A secure, front-end only PWA which uses the Web Crypto API

[hash-tool.web.app](https://hash-tool.web.app)

## Run local

For normal usage install Firebase and serve

```
npm install --global firebase-tools
firebase serve
```

This project only depends on Firebase for hosting so you could run any server from the public directory

```
pushd public; python -m http.server; popd
```
